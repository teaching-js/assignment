# How to get started using the development API

You can use virtual env [recommended]. Make sure you're also using `python3`.

```bash
cd backend
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

or if you don't mind doing things globally:

```
cd backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```
